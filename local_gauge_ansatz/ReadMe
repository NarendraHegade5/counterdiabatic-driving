In this project, following things need to be understood:
1. Dries found out that A^2/2^L is L^2 in system size for nonintegrable model. How is the weight of 1,2,3 ... body operators
 varies as a function of support of these operators? For integrable case, the weight exponentially falls and that's why 
A^2/2^L \sim L.

2. What happens if you take locality ansatz in momentum space? Would you get the same scaling as the one Dries got
 with locality ansatz in real space? Wait, he used to open boundary condition. Does this mean I can't
write it in terms of translationally invariant momentum states?
