Hello authors of DiracQ,

Firstly, hats off for a creating a useful computational tool for working with many-body quantum Hamiltonians!

In DiracQ, I get an output like this no matter --
(J  ** \[Sigma][0, z]**\[Sigma][0, z]) ** 2

It gets difficult to use simplify commands of Mathematica on terms involving this expression. It would be nice if it can be shown as:


(J  *  \[Sigma][0, z] \cross \[Sigma][0, z]) ** 2
