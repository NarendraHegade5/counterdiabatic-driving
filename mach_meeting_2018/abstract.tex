\title{Approximate counterdiabatic driving protocols for quantum non-integrable systems  }
\begin{document}
\maketitle
%\tableofcontents


Due to noise and decoherence from environment, the application of adiabatic protocols in quantum technologies is intensely limited. Counterdiabatic (CD) driving protocols provide a powerful alternative for controlling a quantum system when it's parameter(s) is tuned externally. These protocols allow us to change these parameters rapidly while still mimicking adiabatic dynamics. They have been shown to work well for a wide variety of systems but it's exponentially hard to find exact CD protocols for quantum many-body non-integrable systems. We study a method to approximate CD protocol which avoids exponential sensitivity to perturbations.

%The goal, as of now, is to distinguish between integrable and non-integrable many-body quantum system by studying their approximate gauge adiabatic potential\footnote{We expect results to be valid for classical system too. But for now, we would focus on quantum systems.}
